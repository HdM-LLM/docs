Instead we chose a different method for evaluation. We took an existing job posting from Meta looking for a Frontend Developer, let ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) generate around 40 applications and then manually evaluated them. Afterwards we used GPT-4 to get the same 40 applications evaluated. To be able to compare the results we used the same evaluation categories as we used for the human evaluated applications. These categories are listed below. We also added guidelines wih examples for 0 and 10 points for each category to make the evaluation process as neutral as possible:\n\nEducation and degrees\n\n0: No formal education or relevant degree\n10: Ph.D. in Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, or related field with an exceptional academic record\n\nJavaScript/Typescript Proficiency\n\n0: No knowledge or experience with JavaScript/Typescript\n10: Expert in JavaScript/Typescript, demonstrated by significant contributions to complex front-end systems and extensive experience in architectural design\n\nHTML & CSS Skills\n\n0: Limited or no understanding of HTML & CSS.\n10: Mastery of HTML & CSS, with the ability to create efficient and visually appealing user interfaces\n\nFramework Familiarity (e.g., Prototype JS, MooTools, Dojo)\n\n0: No experience with any JavaScript or TypeScript frameworks\n10: Extensive expertise in multiple Object-Oriented JavaScript Frameworks, such as Prototype JS, MooTools, or Dojo, and a proven ability to architect complex front-end systems\n\nAutomated Testing for Frontend Code\n\n0: No experience in implementing automated testing for frontend code\n10: Adept at implementing comprehensive automated testing strategies for front-end code, ensuring high performance and reliability\n\nCollaboration and Code Reviews\n\n0: Poor collaboration skills and minimal participation in code reviews\n10: Exceptional collaboration skills, actively contributing to design and code reviews, and effectively incorporating innovations from team members\n\nTeamwork\n\n0: Works in isolation, lacks teamwork skills\n10: Outstanding teamwork, demonstrated by effective interaction with product designers, and contributing to the overall improvement of the engineering team’s performance"

We used React because it is a very popular frontend framework and also because it is great for creating reusable components. For creating said components, we used the Material UI library to get a nice and uniform look through the easy customization of each component provided by Material UI. For navigation, we used the React Router library to create the routes for the different pages.\nRegarding project management for both, frontend and backend, we used GitHub Projects to create a Kanban board to keep track of our tasks and to assign them to different team members. We also used Pull Request to review each others code and to make sure that the code is up to our standards. In our opinion, reviewing each others code is a great way to learn from each other, to learn reading and understanding foreign code and to improve our own coding skills. And as a nice side effect of using GitHub Projects, we were able to keep track of our progress and to make sure, that we are on track with our project."
